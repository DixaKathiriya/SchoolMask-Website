  <button class="accordion">Can I change my shipment information or order after purchase? </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Because we are moving into the fulfillment stage of our pre-order (yay!), as of June 27, we no longer can make changes to the order or shipment information after an order has been placed. If you entered the incorrect shipment information, or would like to change your order, please cancel your incorrect order and order again. </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Can I cancel my order after purchase?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Yes, as we are currently accepting pre-orders you can cancel your order for a refund anytime up until we've processed your order for shipping and started the shipping process. Once the product has started to ship, you can no longer cancel or change the order. If you ordered before July 9th, good news! We've already processed your order and it's currently being shipped, however, this means orders placed before July 9th can no longer be cancelled. Due to the hygienic nature of the product, we cannot accept exchanges or returns.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Will this mask prevent COVID-19?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>All of our masks are designed following the guidance of the FDA and CDC's recommendations for fabric masks for source control*, however, all of School Mask Pack's products are not intended for surgical, medical or industrial use. Please do not use in high-risk situations. All of our products do not claim or guarantee to prevent the transmission or infection of any disease, including COVID-19. </p>

  </div>

  <button class="accordion">Do your masks have a filter pocket? </button>

    <p>Our masks do not have a filter pocket, but are made from machine washable, dual-layer fabric with adjustable ear straps and nose clip for a secure fit.</p>

  <button class="accordion">Will the masks prevent glasses from fogging? </button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Yes! When fitted securely around the face, our 3-D face design, nose wire clip, and adjustable fit ear straps will help reduce fogging that glasses wearers experience while wearing a mask. If you experience any fogging, try adjusting the mask to fit closer around the bridge of your nose. </p>
